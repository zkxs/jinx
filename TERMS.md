# Jinx Terms of Service

These terms outline acceptable use of the Jinx Team's Jinx instance ("The Service").

Note that these terms apply only to the Jinx instance maintained and operated by the Jinx Team at
https://github.com/zkxs/jinx: as Jinx is open source software other groups may host their own instances under differing
terms.

## Prohibited Use

- Breaking any applicable federal, state, local, or international law
- Violating the Terms of Service of either Discord or Jinxxy
- Impersonating any Discord or Jinxxy user
- Engaging in any conduct which restricts or inhibits other user's use or enjoyment of The Service, or which (as determined by
  the Jinx Team) may harm the Jinx Team or users of The Service or expose them to liability.

## Account Termination and Suspension

### Termination by You

You may stop using The Service at any time.

If you are a Jinxxy creator and you would like to have your creator data deleted contact us at zkxs00@gmail.com
with subject "JINX DATA DELETION". Note that we will have to verify that you own the relevant Discord account in this
email exchange. We do not currently provide an option to request your Jinx data, as all data is also stored in your
Jinxxy account and can be retrieved from it.

### Termination by the Jinx Team

The Jinx Team reserves the right to suspend or terminate your use of The Service if:
- you breach the terms of this agreement
- we are legally obligated to do so
- we are technically or financially unable to continue hosting The Service

Note that even if your use of The Service is suspended or terminated you may self-host your own Jinx instance under the
terms of the [GNU Affero General Public License](LICENSE).

## Warranty

Jinx and The Service are provided in the hope that they will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the
implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
[GNU Affero General Public License](LICENSE) for more details.

## Changes to these Terms

We may update these terms in the future for reasons including but not limited to:
- making improvements to Jinx
- for legal, regulatory, or security reasons
- to prevent abuse or harm

For privacy reasons, Jinx does not collect contact information and therefore lacks any mechanism to inform users of
Terms of Service updates, so we advise you to review these terms periodically for any changes.

## Contact

If you have any questions or concerns about these terms, please contact us at zkxs00@gmail.com.
