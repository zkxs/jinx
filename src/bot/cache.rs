//! A guild-level cache of Jinxxy API results.
//!
//! This is needed because there are some cases, such as autocomplete, where we need API results
//! however autocomplete needs results at high frequency with low latency: in other words a naive
//! API fetch for each autocomplete would be extremely spammy.
//!
//! The idea here is we have a cache with a short expiry time (maybe 60s) and we reuse the results.
//! I can clear the cache with some kind of background task that checks timestamps ever 60s or so.

//TODO: add cache size estimate to owner_len()
