# Jinx Privacy Policy

This policy explains how Jinx collects, stores, and uses the information provided when used.

Note that this policy applies only to the Jinx instance maintained and operated by the Jinx Team at
https://github.com/zkxs/jinx: as Jinx is open source software other groups may host their own instances under differing
policies.

## Data Collection

### Data Necessary data to manage license keys

The following data is collected and stored by Jinx solely to enable Jinxxy license registration.

- **Jinxxy API keys**: Used to connect Jinx to a creator's Jinxxy store
- **Jinxxy Product IDs**: Uniquely identifies a product to the Jinxxy API
- **Jinxxy License IDs**: Uniquely identifies a license to the Jinxxy API
- **Jinxxy License Activation IDs**: Uniquely identifies a license activation to the Jinxxy API
- **Discord Guild ID**: For guilds Jinx has been installed in
- **Discord Role IDs**: For roles that Jinx can grant
- **Discord User IDs**: For users who have activated licenses

### Error Logging

The following data is collected and stored solely for the purpose of bug reproduction.

- **User Input**: Any user input that results in an internal error
- **Jinxxy API Responses**: Any Jinxxy API responses that result in an internal error
- **Discord API Responses**: Any Discord API responses that result in an internal error

## Data Use

All data collected by Jinx is used solely for the purpose of operating the bot or diagnosing bugs. None of this data
is sold to any third party in any situation. None of this data is shared with any third parties, except in the following
situations:
- **Discord User IDs** are sent to the Jinxxy API in order to associate them with a license activation
- Jinxxy creators (or other users they authorize) may export **Discord User IDs** of users who have activated licenses, allowing them to correlate your Discord and Jinxxy accounts.

## Data Security

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy in the future for reasons including but not limited to:
- making improvements to Jinx
- for legal, regulatory, or security reasons
- to prevent abuse or harm

For privacy reasons, Jinx does not collect contact information and therefore lacks any mechanism to inform users of
policy updates, so we advise you to review this policy periodically for any changes.
